    "# Clustering Neighborhood Change in Austin\n",
    "### Project Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem:\n",
    "Austin is my home, I love it here, and I plan on being here for as long as possible. The city is diverse, open-minded, exciting, entertaining, and beautiful. There are countless music venues, locally owned shops and restaurants, parks, protected green spaces, and secret swimming holes. But Austin is changing, and FAST! For the past decade, Austin has consistently been at or near the top of the fastest growing large cities in the United States. While this population influx is a boon for the city in general, many residents have been or will be unwillingly displaced from their long-time homes due to increased cost of living associated with higher home prices and subsequent hike in real estate taxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamic nature of population change in Austin is causing a pronounced shift in the neighborhood socioeconomic structure. While this shift is a natural process by which cities evolve, the accelerated nature of this shift in certain neighborhoods threatens the livelihood of many long-tenured residents. By understanding key characteristics of neighborhoods which are undergoing the most rapid change, it may be possible to minimize or slow displacement of an underprivileged, underrepresented population while still allowing for meaningful economic growth of the city as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Client:\n",
    "My target client for this project would be the City of Austin. Understanding the factors which force rapid neighborhood change, the city can implement certain regulations that could minimize displacement, unaffordability, and inequality in these neighborhoods. Here is the City of Austin’s “Vision for the Future” written in 2012:\n",
    "\n",
    ">As it approaches its 200th anniversary, Austin is a beacon of sustainability, social equity, and economic opportunity; where diversity and creativity are celebrated; where community needs and values are recognized; where leadership comes from its citizens, and where the necessities of life are affordable and accessible to all complete communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s clear from this statement that Austin has the desire to protect its diverse population as well as facilitate a prosperous economy. This project will give a deeper understanding of neighborhood demographic change to aid the City of Austin in realizing it’s vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "For this project I’ll be using data from the United States Census Bureau and the American Community Survey (ACS). The Census Bureau conducts the decennial (every 10 years) census of the entire population while the ACS conducts yearly surveys at a 1:480 scale which are then aggregated into a 5-year estimate. I’ll be using data from the 2000 census and the 2009-2016 ACS 5-year estimates which are available through the Census Bureau’s American FactFinder portal. All data will be presented in the census tract geography, which is meant to approximately represent a neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data variables that I will be using are meant to be representative of a neighborhood’s social and economic demographics as well as housing market characteristics. Here’s a brief description of the variables I’ll be targeting for this study:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Income (binned interval)\n",
    "* Population (totals)\n",
    "* Education attained (binned ordinal)\n",
    "* Racial makeup (percentage of population)\n",
    "* Rent (binned interval)\n",
    "* Home Value (binned interval)\n",
    "* Unemployment (percentage of workforce)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Approach\n",
    "Because the data for this study does not include labels, I’ll be taking an “Unsupervised Learning” approach using clustering and dimension reduction. I’ll start by pooling all the data for every year and applying k-means clustering and silhouette analysis to estimate the optimum number of clusters and measure the quality of cluster composition. Next I will try a year-by-year clustering. This will be more difficult since each cluster for each year will need to be analyzed to see how it relates to clusters from the previous and following years.\n",
    "\n",
    "My hypothesis is that some neighborhoods will move rapidly between clusters, indicating a region prone to residential displacement and price inequality. Once these neighborhoods have been identified, I’ll search for visual evidence (photos) of the change through the years to bolster my arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Deliverables:\n",
    "The deliverables for this project will be code (Jupyter Notebooks), a write-up of the project analysis and conclusions (Jupyter Notebook, PDF), a set of slides for presenting results (Jupyter Notebook or PowerPoint), and a video presentation of the study (YouTube). \n"
