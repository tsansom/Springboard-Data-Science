# Customer Segmentation using Clustering

## Springboard Mini-Project

This project involves clustering customers based on their response to several e-mail marketing campaigns. First, the data is read in from two sheets of an Excel spreadsheet into python and merged using Pandas. K-Means clustering is then used to find the optimal number of clusters based on the "elbow" method. The silhouette score is introduced as a scoring mechanism for unsupervised clustering. Next, the clusters are visualized by decomposing the data into two components using principal component analysis (PCA).  Last, a number of other clustering techniques were compared to see which was a viable option for this dataset.
